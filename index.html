	<h1>Hi, I'm Viraj Nadkarni!</h1>

	<p>I'm a graduate from the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay, where I got my B.Tech in Electrical Engineering (Hons.) and a Minor degree in Computer Science. During the course of my stay at IIT-B, I was part of a <a hrref = "http://www.auv-iitb.org/">great team</a> of undergrads who manufactured <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_underwater_vehicle">Autonomous Underwater Vehicles</a> every year for the annual <a href = "https://robosub.org/">Robosub competition</a> representing India. I worked on the fifth iteration of the vehicle called <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https%3A%2F%2Fauv-iitb.org%2FTDPs%2FMatsya5A.pdf">Matsya 5.0</a>. I did my <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ch3DQBLmItLoXvpLLkJStGv1_6My_JL-/view?usp=sharing">Bachelor's thesis</a> and research projects exploring the design of <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit">recommendations systems</a> and <a href = "https://www.sg.ethz.ch/research/opinion-dynamics-and-social-influence/">opinion dynamics</a> under the able guidance of <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~dmanju/">Prof. D. Manjunath</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/sharayumoharir/">Prof. Sharayu Moharir</a>. I was also fortunate enough to do an internship at the <a href="https://www.en.aau.dk/">Aalborg University</a> in <a href = "https://photos.app.goo.gl/AWg6KCrtWFFqqker5">Denmark</a> under <a href="https://vbn.aau.dk/en/persons/112991">Prof. Jimmy Jessen Nielsen</a>, where I spent my summer working as a visiting researcher in 2019. During my internship there, I worked on managing burst errors and energy consumption while using multiple wireless interfaces (WiFi and LTE) at the same time, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning">Reinforcement Learning</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">Markov chains</a>.
